## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Neovim Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Temp file approach may not work on all platforms
   - Mitigation: Test early, have fallback editor ready

2. **Database Driver Issues**
   - Risk: Driver bugs or version incompatibilities
   - Mitigation: Use well-maintained drivers, test thoroughly

3. **Performance with Large Results**
   - Risk: UI freezes with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Implement streaming and pagination early

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Risk: Works on macOS but breaks on Linux/Windows
   - Mitigation: Test on all platforms continuously

### Schedule Risks

1. **Feature Creep**
   - Risk: Adding too many features delays launch
   - Mitigation: Stick to MVP scope, move extras to Phase 4

2. **Underestimated Complexity**
   - Risk: Tasks take longer than estimated
   - Mitigation: Build 20% buffer into each phase

---

## Development Principles

1. **Ship Early, Ship Often**: Release working increments
2. **User Feedback Driven**: Get real users testing ASAP
3. **Quality Over Features**: Better to have fewer features that work well
4. **Documentation Matters**: Write docs as you code
5. **Test Continuously**: Don't wait until the end

## Next Steps

**Week 1 starts now!**

```bash
# Let's begin
mkdir lazydb
cd lazydb
go mod init github.com/yourusername/lazydb
```

Good luck! üöÄ
